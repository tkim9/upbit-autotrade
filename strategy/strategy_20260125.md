# Trading Strategy Document

## 1. Executive Summary
This document outlines the trading strategy employed by a highly successful individual trader, known as "원효띠", who transformed an initial investment of approximately 600 million Korean Won into assets worth over 3 trillion Korean Won within four years. The strategy hinges on meticulous chart-based trading, flexible market adaptation, disciplined risk management, and conservative leverage usage.

## 2. Key Concepts
- **Chart-Based Trading**: Prioritizing technical analysis over news-driven trades.
- **Market Flexibility**: Adapting to current market conditions to guide trading decisions.
- **Risk Management**: Implementing strict risk management through planned exits and cautious leverage.
- **Compounding Returns**: Achieving wealth through consistent small gains rather than large, risky bets.

## 3. Entry Rules
- Use technical chart patterns and support/resistance levels to determine entry points.
- Focus on large-cap coins for reliability.
- Enter positions when market conditions are favorable, as indicated by market sentiment and chart analysis.

## 4. Exit Rules
- Predetermine stop-loss levels based on the initial trading plan.
- Exit positions if market conditions deviate from the expected scenario or if emotional stability is compromised.
- Employ mechanical stop-loss in cases where the initial trading hypothesis is invalidated.

## 5. Risk Management
- Invest only 20-30% of total trading capital in any single trade.
- Use low leverage, initially up to 10x for smaller capital and reduce leverage as capital grows.
- Avoid unplanned averaging down on losing positions; only engage in it when highly confident and experienced.

## 6. Technical Indicators
- **Candlestick Patterns**: Used to gauge market trends and reversals.
- **Moving Averages**: Utilized to assess market trends and potential rebounds, not as a primary tool for trade execution.
- Avoid complex indicators like MACD, RSI, and Bollinger Bands, focusing instead on basic chart analysis and market psychology.

## 7. Market Conditions
- Trade primarily during periods of clear market trends, either bullish or bearish.
- Monitor economic indicators and news that could significantly impact market sentiment, adjusting strategies accordingly.

## 8. Implementation Steps
1. **Chart Analysis**: Regularly practice and analyze price charts to understand market psychology and identify potential trade setups.
2. **Set Entry and Exit Points**: Determine these based on technical analysis and market sentiment.
3. **Capital Allocation**: Allocate no more than 20-30% of total capital per trade, adjusting leverage accordingly.
4. **Risk Management**: Establish stop-loss levels and adhere to them strictly to manage emotional and financial risk.
5. **Market Monitoring**: Stay informed on macroeconomic news and market dynamics to adapt trading strategies as needed.
6. **Review and Adjust**: Continuously evaluate trading performance and strategy effectiveness, making necessary adjustments.

## 9. Notes and Considerations
- **Emotional Discipline**: Maintain emotional control and avoid deviating from the plan due to market noise or emotional reactions.
- **Continuous Learning**: Engage in ongoing learning and practice, as successful investing is a result of consistent study and adaptation.
- **Avoid Overcomplication**: Stick to straightforward chart analysis and avoid relying heavily on complex indicators or patterns.
- **Longevity in Trading**: Focus on small, consistent gains that compound over time rather than seeking large, quick profits.

This trading strategy emphasizes disciplined trading based on charts and market psychology, with a strong focus on risk management and capital preservation. It serves as a guideline for traders aiming to achieve consistent profitability in volatile markets like cryptocurrency.
